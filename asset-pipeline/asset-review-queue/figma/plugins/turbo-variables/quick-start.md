```

### Step 2: Load in Figma Desktop

3. Plugin appears in Plugins menu

### Step 3: Extract Colors from Your Buttons

1. Select your button components in Figma
2. Run "Turbo Variables" plugin
3. Click "📤 Extract Styles from Figma"
4. Downloads `figma-extracted-styles.json`

## 📊 What You Get

The extracted JSON contains:
- All colors from your selected components
- Usage counts (how many times each color is used)
- Source information (which component)
- Automatic categorization (foundation, accent, heritage, etc.)

## 🎯 Next: Compare with Local Tokens

Move the JSON to your project:
```bash
mv ~/Downloads/figma-extracted-styles.json /Users/pennyplatt/Documents/9BitStudios/Oksana/quantum-spatial/design-system/asset-pipeline/
```

Then compare the hex values against:
`/quantum-spatial/design-system/tokens/brand/quantumSpatialTokens.ts`

**See which colors are different and need updating!**
