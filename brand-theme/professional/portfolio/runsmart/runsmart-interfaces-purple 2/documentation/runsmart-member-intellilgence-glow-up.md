## Strategic Approach for RunSmart

### Phase 1: Design Foundation (Manual in Figma)

**Action items:**

1. Create designs directly in Figma using your HTML as reference
2. Establish component library with variables
3. Build out the screens I'll recommend below
4. Then use MCP to accelerate development

### Phase 2: Enhanced Dashboard Screens

Here are **5 additional high-impact screens** to elevate your presentation:

### **1. Executive Dashboard (For Steve)**

**Purpose:** C-suite revenue & retention overview

**Key metrics:**

- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) trend
- Customer Lifetime Value by cohort
- Churn prevention ROI calculator
- Board-ready KPI cards
- Automated intervention success rates

**Insight:** Shows AI directly impacting bottom line

---

### **2. Member Journey Map (For Steve)**

**Purpose:** Visualize the entire member lifecycle

**Features:**

- Onboarding → Active → At-Risk → Win-back stages
- Drop-off points highlighted with AI predictions
- Intervention touchpoints marked
- Conversion funnel with AI optimization opportunities

**Insight:** Demonstrates where AI creates value at each stage

---

### **3. Member Personal Dashboard (Member-facing)**

**Purpose:** Personalized home screen for runners

**Features:**

- Today's recommended workout (AI-generated)
- Progress ring toward race goal
- "You vs. Past You" comparison stats
- Streak counter with motivation
- Quick-access training plan adjustments
- Community challenges feed
- Weather-based run recommendations

**Insight:** Shows how AI personalizes without being creepy

---

### **4. Smart Training Plan View (Member-facing)**

**Purpose:** Adaptive calendar interface

**Features:**

- Week/month calendar view with AI-adjusted workouts
- Color-coded intensity levels
- "Why this workout?" explanations
- One-tap workout swaps based on fatigue/schedule
- Rest day recommendations with reasoning
- Integration with race countdown
- Progress photos/notes timeline

**Insight:** Demonstrates AI as intelligent coach, not rigid algorithm

---

### **5. Predictive Intervention Center (For Steve)**

**Purpose:** Real-time operations dashboard

**Features:**

- Live feed of at-risk members (sortable by risk score)
- Recommended action queue with priority
- One-click intervention deployment
- A/B test results for messaging
- Success/failure tracking per intervention type
- "Set it and forget it" automation rules
- Cost savings calculator

**Insight:** Shows operational efficiency gains from AI

---

## Additional Enhancements to Existing Screens

### Dashboard Improvements:

- **Add cohort analysis panel** (compare new vs. veteran members)
- **Include seasonal trends visualization** (engagement patterns by month)
- **Real-time notification center** (alert Steve to critical situations)
- **Export/share functionality** for investor/board meetings

### Member Detail Enhancements:

- **Sentiment analysis** from member messages/feedback
- **Social graph** showing connections to other members
- **Predicted optimal contact timing** (when they're most receptive)
- **Comparison to similar member profiles** (anonymized benchmarking)

### Email Intelligence Additions:

- **Subject line A/B test simulator** with predicted open rates
- **Send time optimizer** based on member behavior
- **Template performance leaderboard**
- **Automated follow-up sequences** triggered by behavior

## Workflow to Accelerate Your Design Process

**1. Component Strategy:**

- Build reusable stat cards, charts, buttons in Figma
- Use Figma variables for colors/spacing (MCP can extract these)
- Create auto-layout frames for responsive behavior

**2. AI Tool Integration:**

- Use ChatGPT/Claude for design copy generation
- Use Figma plugins like "Chart" for data visualizations
- Consider "Figma to Code" plugins for rapid prototyping

**3. Presentation Flow for Steve:**

```
1. Executive Dashboard (business impact)
2. Predictive Intervention Center (operational efficiency)
3. Member Journey Map (strategic overview)
4. Member Detail + Email Intelligence (tactical execution)
5. Member-facing screens (product vision)

```

## Quick Win: What to Build First

**Priority Order:**

1. **Predictive Intervention Center** - Shows immediate operational value
2. **Member Personal Dashboard** - Demonstrates product differentiation
3. **Executive Dashboard** - Speaks Steve's language ($$)

These three will give you the strongest narrative arc: business value → operational efficiency → member experience.
