        <p><strong>Re: Lead E-Commerce Developer Position</strong></p>
        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <p>I'm applying because I solve the problem most teams face: making design systems actually work in production. After 20 years as a creative director, I learned to code because I was tired of watching beautiful designs break during implementation. Now I build the systems that prevent that from happening.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Why Quality Doesn't Break at Launch</h2>
        <p>When I was art directing campaigns, I learned that brilliant creative work dies if production quality fails. That training made me obsessive about validation—not as bureaucracy, but as craft. Here's what that looks like in Shopify development:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TypeScript validation</strong> catches design system violations before they ship</li>
            <li><strong>Automated testing</strong> runs accessibility and performance checks on every commit</li>
            <li><strong>Component libraries</strong> with built-in responsive behavior and ARIA requirements</li>
            <li><strong>Design token systems</strong> that enforce brand consistency across touchpoints</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When designs go live, they're already validated against accessibility standards, brand guidelines, and performance benchmarks. No surprises. No rework. No compromises.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Building Integration Intelligence</h2>
        <p>I built Oksana—a brand-aware content intelligence platform—to demonstrate how complex integrations should work. Currently running as a Notion integration (Vercel interface in development), it syncs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shopify</strong> for e-commerce data and product management</li>
            <li><strong>Klaviyo</strong> for email marketing intelligence</li>
            <li><strong>Grid API</strong> for analytics visualization</li>
            <li><strong>Notion</strong> as the content operations hub</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For my client Petersen Games, this integration provides real-time analytics that inform content strategy decisions. I practice what your job description calls for: content automation, third-party API integration, and workflow optimization that actually works in production.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Results, Not Just Features</h2>
        <p>As Creative UX Lead at RunSmart Online, I increased user engagement 40% and grew memberships 25%. How?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Restructured navigation based on actual user behavior data, not assumptions</li>
            <li>Built analytics dashboards tracking conversion funnels in real-time</li>
            <li>Implemented responsive designs with systematic A/B testing validation</li>
            <li>Collaborated with engineering to build a design system that scaled</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These weren't cosmetic changes—they were systematic UX improvements informed by data and validated through testing. The kind of work that moves business metrics.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">How I Work</h2>
        <p>I start by understanding what success looks like for the business, then build the technical implementation that delivers it. My certifications plus systematic validation approach plus integration expertise means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Faster builds</strong> — Reusable component libraries and design tokens accelerate development cycles</li>
            <li><strong>Better quality</strong> — Type safety and automated validation ensure consistency at scale</li>
            <li><strong>Smarter decisions</strong> — Data-informed choices backed by analytics and user behavior</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm particularly drawn to your collaborative environment. My systematic thinking (part of being neurodivergent) naturally produces documentation and processes that make cross-functional work smoother. When designers, marketers, and developers all work from a single source of truth, projects move faster.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Technical Alignment</h2>
        <p>Your requirements match my current stack:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shopify Plus</strong> — Liquid, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3/SASS, theme development</li>
            <li><strong>API Integration</strong> — REST, GraphQL, Webhooks, third-party app management</li>
            <li><strong>Automation</strong> — Matrixify workflows, content/product update systems</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics</strong> — Google Analytics, Shopify Reports, BI dashboard implementation</li>
            <li><strong>Version Control</strong> — Git-based workflows, deployment automation</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> — WCAG compliance, Apple HIG alignment, ARIA implementation</li>
            <li><strong>Frameworks</strong> — Headless commerce experience with Next.js</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm also IxDF certified with 20 years of design direction experience in Adobe Creative Cloud, which means I speak both designer and developer fluently.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <p>I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my validation-first approach and integration expertise can contribute to Johnson Health Tech's e-commerce growth. I'm available for immediate engagement and can provide portfolio examples, design system documentation, and analytics dashboards upon request.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="signature">
        <p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
