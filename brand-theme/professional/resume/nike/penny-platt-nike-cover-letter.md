Nike World Headquarters
Attn: Hiring Manager – Graphic Designer 2, Production Artist II
1 Bowerman Drive
Beaverton, OR 97005

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Graphic Designer 2 – Production Artist II position at Nike World Headquarters. As a Portland-based designer with 20+ years of experience creating production-ready graphics for sports, wellness, and multi-product brands, I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to Nike's iconic apparel design legacy.

**Sports Content Expertise with Measurable Results**

In my most recent in-house role, I served as Creative Director for RunSmart Online, a running coaching platform where I developed a comprehensive visual system for 1,000+ active athletes. This work directly parallels Nike's apparel production needs:

• **Content Strategy & Production:** Created 100+ pieces of training content including workout schematics, seasonal campaign graphics, athlete profiles, and educational infographics—all maintaining rigorous brand consistency across digital and print applications.

• **User Journey Optimization:** Conducted a complete content audit and designed user journey visualization for the onboarding flow, resulting in a 40% increase in user engagement and 25% membership growth.

• **Systematic Design Execution:** Developed production templates for recurring content types (training plans, race prep guides, nutrition content) that enabled consistent, efficient output while maintaining creative quality.

• **Multi-Channel Coordination:** Maintained visual coherence across email campaigns, social media, blog graphics, and app interface—experience that translates directly to Nike's need for consistency across athlete uniforms, retail merchandise, and digital platforms.

**Production-Ready Graphics & Technical Precision**

My background includes extensive production art experience across multiple industries:

• **Petersen Games:** Directed design for 100+ SKU product line, creating production specifications for complex multi-component graphics and managing international creative teams—experience highly relevant to Nike's global production coordination.

• **ACHS:** Led design for e-commerce platform generating $500K+ annual revenue, creating product photography layouts, promotional graphics, and seasonal campaigns while maintaining brand consistency across 100+ digital touchpoints.

• **Texas Creative:** Produced responsive email templates and landing pages with conversion optimization focus, developing brand identity systems and digital style guides for diverse clients.

**Technical Skills & Tools Alignment**

I bring expert-level proficiency in Adobe Illustrator and the full Adobe Suite, with particular strength in creating production-ready vector graphics and detailed schematics. I'm familiar with 3D apparel visualization workflows and have experience with collaborative tools including Smartsheets, Airtable, and Miro. I'm a quick learner with CLO and other specialized tools, and I thrive in fast-paced environments requiring attention to detail and multi-project management.

**Why Nike & Why Now**

Nike's commitment to innovation in athletic performance inspires me, and the opportunity to work on apparel graphics that directly impact athletes resonates deeply with my experience creating content for running coaches and competitive athletes. I understand the intersection of technical specification requirements and creative expression that makes sports apparel graphics both functional and inspiring.

As a Portland resident, I'm immediately available for the November 23rd start date with no relocation required. The hybrid model aligns perfectly with my work preferences, and I'm excited about the opportunity to collaborate onsite with Nike's Production Art team while maintaining the focus time needed for detailed production work.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my sports content experience, production design expertise, and systematic approach to brand consistency can contribute to Nike's apparel graphics team. I'm available for an interview at your convenience and can provide work samples demonstrating my relevant sports and apparel design experience.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Nike's continued excellence in athletic apparel design.

Sincerely,

Penny Platt
