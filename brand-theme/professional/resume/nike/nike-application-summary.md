## KEY MESSAGING POINTS

### Your RunSmart Story (3-Minute Version):

**Setup:**
"I spent three years as Creative Director for RunSmart Online, a running coaching platform serving over 1,000 active athletes—from recreational runners to competitive marathoners."

**Challenge:**
"When I joined, content was scattered and inconsistent. Coaches created their own graphics without brand guidelines, and athletes struggled to find relevant training information."

**Approach:**
"I conducted a comprehensive content audit, mapping every piece of content across the platform. This revealed gaps between what athletes needed versus what we were producing. I then designed a complete visual system with production templates for recurring content—training plans, educational infographics, seasonal campaigns."

**Result:**
"The systematic approach paid off: 40% increase in user engagement and 25% membership growth. But more importantly, we created a sustainable system where new content maintained brand consistency while coaches could personalize for their athletes."

**Relevance to Nike:**
"That experience taught me to balance creative quality with production efficiency—exactly what Nike needs for maintaining consistency from athlete uniforms to retail merchandise across global production."
