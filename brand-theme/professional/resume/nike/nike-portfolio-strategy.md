## Interview Preparation Talking Points

### Your RunSmart Story

**Setup:**
"I spent three years as Creative Director for RunSmart Online, a running coaching platform serving over 1,000 active athletes—from recreational runners to competitive marathoners."

**Challenge:**
"When I joined, their content was scattered and inconsistent. Coaches were creating their own graphics without brand guidelines, and the user experience made it hard for athletes to find relevant training information."

**Approach:**
"I conducted a comprehensive content audit, mapping out every piece of content across their platform. This revealed patterns in what athletes actually needed versus what we were producing. I then designed a complete visual system with production templates for recurring content types—training plans, educational infographics, seasonal campaigns."

**Result:**
"The systematic approach paid off: we saw a 40% increase in user engagement and 25% membership growth. But more importantly, we created a sustainable system where new content maintained brand consistency while coaches could still personalize for their athletes."

**Relevance to Nike:**
"That experience taught me how to balance creative quality with production efficiency—exactly what Nike needs for maintaining consistency from athlete uniforms to retail merchandise across global production."

### Questions You Should Ask

1. "What's the typical mix of athlete uniform graphics versus retail merchandise in this role?"
2. "How does the Production Art team collaborate with design and product teams?"
3. "What are the biggest workflow challenges the team is currently working to improve?"

**About Process:**
1. "What tools and systems does the team use for file management and version control?"
2. "How are priority decisions made when multiple projects have overlapping deadlines?"
3. "What does 'accuracy' look like in practice for production-ready files at Nike?"

**About Growth:**
1. "Are there opportunities to contribute to workflow improvement projects?"
2. "How does the team stay updated on new tools and production techniques?"
3. "What does success look like in the first 90 days for this role?"
