    <div class="section">
        <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">Dear Hiring Team at Ligonier Ministries,</p>
        
        <p>I'm writing to apply for the Web Designer position on your Growth & Engagement team. As someone raised in the Christian faith and with years of service on church media teams, I deeply understand the unique responsibility of creating digital experiences that serve the Church. Ligonier's mission—to proclaim, teach, and defend the holiness of God—resonates with me not just professionally, but personally.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Why This Ministry and This Role</h2>
        <p>Growing up in the church, I served on media teams where I learned that design decisions in ministry contexts carry weight beyond aesthetics. Whether it was creating bulletin layouts, presentation slides for worship, or later, early church websites, I understood that clarity and accessibility weren't just design principles—they were acts of service. When someone is seeking to grow in their faith, unclear navigation or poorly structured content becomes a barrier to discipleship.</p>
        
        <p>That perspective has shaped my entire 20-year career. I approach web design not as decoration, but as stewardship—ensuring that the message reaches people clearly, that barriers to understanding are removed, and that every interaction honors both the content and the audience. For ministry work, this means designing experiences where theological depth and digital accessibility work together, not against each other.</p>
        
        <p>Ligonier's commitment to theological clarity and global reach requires web experiences that serve both the seasoned believer and the seeker. That's the work I want to do.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Design That Serves Mission and Growth</h2>
        <p>You need someone who can translate campaign objectives into landing pages that convert, optimize user flows for donor engagement, and ensure that design decisions reflect both brand identity and ministry priorities. My background positions me well for this:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Content-driven design experience:</strong> At American College of Healthcare Sciences (ACHS), I designed website experiences for an educational nonprofit where clarity and trust were paramount. Complex course structures needed to be intuitive; prospective students needed to understand value quickly. I created landing page templates, optimized information architecture, and developed design systems that scaled across 100+ pages while maintaining consistency.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Growth-focused optimization:</strong> For RunSmart Online, I led UX redesigns that increased engagement 40% and grew memberships 25%. This wasn't about making things "look better"—it was systematic optimization: analyzing user behavior data, A/B testing page variants, restructuring navigation based on conversion funnels, and continuously iterating based on results.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Campaign-specific landing pages:</strong> I've designed and implemented dozens of campaign landing pages for e-commerce, education, and service businesses. I understand how to balance persuasive design with clarity, create clear calls-to-action without being manipulative, and ensure mobile-first responsive experiences that work across devices.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Real example of mission-aligned work:</strong> When ACHS needed to communicate their holistic health philosophy to prospective students, I didn't just create attractive pages—I designed a content hierarchy that honored their educational mission while addressing practical concerns (accreditation, career outcomes, student support). The result was a 35% increase in qualified lead submissions and improved clarity scores from user testing.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Cross-Functional Design Leadership</h2>
        <p>This role requires collaboration across teams—working with Technology Services on implementation, partnering with Growth on testing strategy, and supporting the Design team on multi-channel campaigns. I thrive in that environment:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clean developer handoff:</strong> I design in Figma with implementation in mind—organized components, clear annotations, documented interactions, and design specs that account for technical feasibility. I understand HTML/CSS well enough to know what's realistic, which means fewer surprises during development and smoother collaboration with engineering teams.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Design system contribution:</strong> I've built and maintained design systems for multiple organizations. I understand the importance of systematic typography scales, accessible color palettes, reusable component libraries, and documentation that helps teams apply guidelines consistently across channels.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Multi-channel support:</strong> Beyond web, I've created digital assets for email campaigns, social media graphics, paid advertising, and print materials. I understand how to maintain visual cohesion across touchpoints while adapting designs for different contexts and constraints.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">User-Centered Design Grounded in Purpose</h2>
        <p>Ministry websites serve diverse audiences—longtime supporters who need depth, seekers who need clarity, and donors who need transparency. Effective design means understanding these different needs and creating experiences that serve them all:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accessibility as ministry:</strong> I build WCAG-compliant interfaces not just because it's required, but because accessibility is about dignity and inclusion. Semantic HTML, proper heading hierarchy, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, sufficient color contrast—these aren't checkboxes, they're how we ensure content reaches everyone, including those with disabilities.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Typography and hierarchy for readability:</strong> For content-driven sites, thoughtful typography is essential. I work with systematic type scales, establish clear visual hierarchy, and ensure that long-form content remains readable across devices. Good typography serves the text, making theological teaching accessible without overwhelming readers.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Responsive design for global reach:</strong> I design mobile-first, understanding that many users worldwide access content primarily on phones. Every layout, every interaction, every user flow is tested across devices to ensure consistent, quality experiences regardless of how people access your content.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Iterative Design and Testing Culture</h2>
        <p>You mentioned A/B testing and continuous optimization—I share that approach. Good design isn't about defending initial concepts; it's about learning what actually works:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>I design page variants for testing with hypotheses about what will improve conversions</li>
            <li>I analyze results to understand not just <em>what</em> performed better, but <em>why</em></li>
            <li>I iterate based on user feedback, analytics data, and testing insights</li>
            <li>I document learnings to inform future design decisions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This approach requires humility—being willing to be wrong, to learn from data, and to serve the mission rather than my ego. That mindset aligns naturally with ministry work.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Technical Qualifications and Portfolio</h2>
        <p><strong>Design Tools:</strong> Primary workflow in Figma for UI/UX design, prototyping, and design system management. Extensive experience with Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) for graphic design assets.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Web Design Experience:</strong> 20+ years designing responsive, accessible websites. Strong understanding of HTML/CSS for design feasibility. Experience designing for WordPress, custom CMS platforms, and headless architectures. Portfolio demonstrates intuitive interfaces, thoughtful UX flows, and systematic design thinking.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Design Systems:</strong> Built component libraries, design token systems, and style guides for multiple organizations. Experience maintaining brand consistency across digital channels while allowing flexibility for campaign-specific needs.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Collaboration Approach:</strong> Value feedback and iteration, work effectively with cross-functional teams, communicate design decisions clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, and document work for team alignment.</p>
        
        <p>Portfolio available at 9bitstudios.io showcasing responsive design work, landing page campaigns, educational website projects, and design system documentation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Faith Alignment and Statement of Support</h2>
        <p>I affirm Ligonier's General Statement of Faith and deeply respect the theological clarity that shapes this ministry's teaching. Having grown up in Reformed theology and served in church contexts, I understand the importance of precision in communicating biblical truth. The holiness of God isn't just a theological concept to design around—it's central to how I approach this work.</p>
        
        <p>I'm drawn to Ligonier because you take both theology and digital ministry seriously. You don't compromise doctrinal depth for the sake of being "accessible," nor do you hide strong biblical teaching behind poor user experiences. That integration—faithful content delivered through excellent design—is exactly the kind of work I want to spend my time doing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section closing">
        <p>This role represents meaningful work in service of the Church's global discipleship. I would be honored to contribute my design skills, ministry understanding, and collaborative approach to Ligonier's digital presence.</p>
        
        <p>I'm excited to discuss how my experience designing user-centered, mission-aligned web experiences can support your Growth & Engagement objectives. My portfolio demonstrates the kind of systematic, accessible, purpose-driven design work this role requires.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for your consideration and for the faithful work Ligonier does in serving the Church.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 24px;">In Christ,</p>
