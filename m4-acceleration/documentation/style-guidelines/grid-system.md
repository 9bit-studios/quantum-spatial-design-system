# Grid System

### Dimensional Grid Framework

Our grid system is based on an 8-point grid with quantum-spatial dimensional characteristics:

- **Base Unit**: 8px
- **Spacing Increments**: 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 40px, 48px, 64px
- **Container Padding**: 24px (mobile), 32px (tablet), 40px (desktop)
- **Column Structure**: 4 columns (mobile), 8 columns (tablet), 12 columns (desktop)

### Grid Characteristics

- **Primary Grid**: Visible organizational structure (15-20% opacity)
- **Dimensional Grid**: Secondary grid with perspective effect (8-12% opacity)
- **Quantum Alignment**: Elements align precisely to the grid, with occasional deliberate breaks to show "quantum leaps"

### Implementation Rules

- Implement grid fade based on distance from viewpoint
- Use parallax effects sparingly and with natural physics
- Maintain consistent line weight appropriate to the application
- Grid should provide spatial organization without visual dominance
