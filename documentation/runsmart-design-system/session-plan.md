## 🎯 INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS

### "Walk me through this project"

**Your Answer:**
"I built RunSmart, an AI-powered running coach retention platform. It's a complete system: iPhone member app, coach dashboard, Apple Watch integration, and iPad intervention center.

**Design System:** I started with a comprehensive token system - every color, spacing, and typography scale documented. Built 30+ reusable components in Figma with proper variants and states.

**Technical:** Used SwiftUI for iOS, React for web, M4 Neural Engine for on-device AI. The coach dashboard reduced intervention time by 40% and saved $4.2K in retained revenue in first month.

**Platform Integration:** Full Apple HIG compliance - 44px touch targets, Dynamic Island awareness, SF Pro typography, VoiceOver support.

**Workflow:** Figma → code pipeline automated with design tokens. Components export to React/SwiftUI with one click."

**Follow-up Questions You'll Crush:**
- "Show me the design system" → Open Figma, show tokens
- "How did you handle responsive design?" → Auto Layout demo
- "What about accessibility?" → VoiceOver labels, contrast ratios
- "Can you show me the code?" → Export component in real-time
