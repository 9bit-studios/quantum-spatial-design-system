  These parameters ensure modern dashboard consistency while maintaining the quantum-spatial aesthetic.
  
  ⏺ Quantum-Spatial Glassmorphic Design Settings Summary

  Core Glassmorphic Implementation:
  - Background opacity layers: 0.2 (primary), 0.7 (content), 0.9 (focus)
  - Blur standards: 20px (backgrounds), 4-6px (glow effects), 2-8px (elements)
  - Systematic opacity scale: 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.15, 0.1

  Quantum Color Gradients:
  - Retro-futuristic base: #0A0621 → #131A36 → #331F4A → #0D0D15
  - Quantum spectrum: #3DFF74 → #00FFC8 → #613FE7 → #FF2D55
  - Purple quantum core: #48319D with opacity fades

  Spatial Perspective Effects:
  - Gaming 3D perspective: skewX(-10) skewY(5)
  - Vaporwave dramatic: skewX(-20) scale(1, 2)
  - Cosmic subtle: skewX(10) skewY(5)

  Filter Implementation:
  - Retro glow: feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="4"
  - Neon glow: feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="6"
  - Mix blend mode: overlay with stroke-opacity="0.7"

  These settings create luminous depth through layered transparency, spatial distortion via transforms, and quantum luminescence through calibrated glow filters.
