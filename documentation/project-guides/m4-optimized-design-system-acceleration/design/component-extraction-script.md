# Component Extraction Script

The first artifact provides a powerful analysis tool that will:

- **Scan all your .tsx files** and categorize components
- **Calculate complexity scores** to identify which components need refactoring
- **Extract design token usage** patterns across your codebase
- **Generate reorganization scripts** to clean up your file structure
- **Create a component catalog** with recommendations

## 🎨 **Simplified Design System**

The second artifact replaces your multiple token systems with:

- **Single source of truth** - one `useDesignSystem()` hook
- **Pre-built components** - Button, Card, Navigation, Carousel, Filter
- **Utility functions** - `glass()`, `gradient()`, `color()` helpers
- **Consistent patterns** - all components follow the same structure

## 📖 **Complete Organization Guide**

The third artifact provides:

- **Step-by-step migration strategy**
- **File structure recommendations** (quantum-pixel design principles)
- **Token type explanations** (primitive → semantic → component)
- **Best practices and common pitfalls**
- **Success metrics to track improvement**

## 🦄 **Quick Start Process**

1. **Run Analysis** (5 minutes)
    
    ```bash
    
    bash
    node component-extraction-system.js
    
    ```
    
2. **Review Results** (15 minutes)
    - Check `component-catalog.json` for your current state
    - Identify high-complexity components to refactor
3. **Implement New System** (1-2 hours)
    - Replace your token imports with `useDesignSystem()`
    - Start with simple components first
4. **Reorganize Structure** (30 minutes)
    
    ```bash
    
    bash
    chmod +x reorganize-components.sh
    ./reorganize-components.sh
    
    ```
    

## ✨ **Key Benefits**

- **Reduced confusion** - One design system instead of 4-5
- **Modular components** - Navigation, Carousel, Filter ready to use
- **Easy maintenance** - Clear patterns and documentation
- **Better performance** - Eliminated duplicate styles
- **Developer happiness** - Simple, predictable API

The system respects your excellent existing styles while making them much easier to work with. You'll keep the beautiful glassmorphic effects and smooth animations, but with a clean, maintainable structure underneath.
